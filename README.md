# DeepFake
Recent advances in visual media technology have led to new tools for processing and
multimedia contents. Modern AI-based technologies have provided tools to create extremely
realistic manipulated videos, without any efforts. Such spurious videos, named DeepFakes,
may constitute a serious threat to attack the reputation of public subjects or to address the
general opinion on a certain event. The term ‘DeepFake’ (a portmanteau of deep learning and
fake) can be unhelpful and confusing as the underlying technology has potential for both
creative and nefarious use.
## Dataset used
Deepfake Detection Google dataset will be used which contains original and deepfake videos of 28 actors, total consisting of 3000+ manipulated videos and 360 original. Manipulated videos are created using GAN. A GAN is a class of machine learning frameworks. Given a training set, this technique learns to generate new data with the same statistics as the training set. For example, a GAN trained on photographs can generate new photographs that look at least superficially authentic to human observers, having many realistic characteristics.
