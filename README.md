# DeepFake
Recent advances in visual media technology have led to new tools for processing and
multimedia contents. Modern AI-based technologies have provided tools to create extremely
realistic manipulated videos, without any efforts. Such spurious videos, named DeepFakes,
may constitute a serious threat to attack the reputation of public subjects or to address the
general opinion on a certain event. The term ‘DeepFake’ (a portmanteau of deep learning and
fake) can be unhelpful and confusing as the underlying technology has potential for both
creative and nefarious use.
